great hotel, great city, not sure hotel renovated negative reviews written great us.my girlfriend stayed week great time, clean looked new, staff nice good recommendations out.to fair did n't spend time room, nice pool beach day lobby bar start night going night, bar really busy not destination.i think reviewer said exactly like pictures website, looks good probably satisfied.i travel lot work usually stay typical chains think people south beach expecting type mainstream place, not city hopefully gets not hotels restaurants, sobe like completely different country good way, certainly stay hotel,
