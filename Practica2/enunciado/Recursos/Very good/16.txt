pretty good value visit seattle frequently, 1 2 days longer, staying 2 nights not worth especially hotel raised rates lately, recommend ramada steps away, staying longer time perfect, especially families, fancier hotels town warwick satisfy families especially expensive suites, swimming pool bit dark balconies acually just big step windows views location perfect, small restaurant dont overpriced does not offer better food downtown,
