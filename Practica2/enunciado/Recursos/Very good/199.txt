great hotel great location great hotel second time stayed, significant room renovations stay late 1990s, location fabulous walking distance alot great restaurants shopping easy access public transportation, convenient airport 10 15 minute cab ride, disconcerting thing foreign diplomat staying hotel police dogs secret service agents, none hotel staff know going n't allowed say rooms small comfortable, wonderful beds great showers shower heads, fitness center adequate nicer walking public garden boston common block away.definitely recommend hotel,
