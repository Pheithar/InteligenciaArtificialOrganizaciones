lawrence-convienient hotel lawrence really nice, took 2 year old dallas train ride loves trains chose lawrence directly amrak station west end activities, chose right, staff great, took hotel shuttle aquarium zoo no charge, came pick super friendly, youve pushed tired toddler stroller hill know nice shuttle service west end activities walking distance, theyre just blocks over.the hotel classy small, like mini version, maintained, skeptical having queen size bed king worked best, gave needed snuggle time, cant beat price service, nice space lobby rooms breakfast areas guess nothing perfect, nice trip stay sure,
