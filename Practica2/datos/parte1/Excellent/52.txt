stay tonight, slept wonderful, love comforters double sheets, kids loved indoor pool morning hot chocolate, left upscale shower samples not typical brands, got room service dinner nights n't terribly expensive actually tasted good, parking does cost 21 bucks parking just expensive seattle, got great deal room did n't feel bad extras, paid extra internet room bucks day internet long distance phone calls, definitely stay,
